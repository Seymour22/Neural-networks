# Neural-Networks

In [Project 1](https://github.com/Seymour22/Neural-Networks/blob/main/Project%201:%20Layer-wise%20Relevance%20Propagation%20(LRP)%20algorithm%20for%20a%20CNN.ipynb), I implement a LRP for a CNN that distinguishes a country' flag. The LRP operates by propagating the prediction backward in the neural network and is a function of neuron activations and weights as explained in https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-28954-6_10. Dataset was downloaded from Google images with keywords search American and Ukrainian tank flag
