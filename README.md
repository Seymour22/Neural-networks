# Neural-Networks

In [Project 1](https://github.com/Seymour22/Neural-networks/blob/main/Project%201%20Action%20detection%20using%20OpenCV.ipynb) I display if a head turns left or right using OpenCV algorithm that detects these action from a set of video frames. Here I train the algorithm on video files rather than dynamic capture from the webcam. This enables to build a model from videos acquired from multiple sources.


In [Project 2](https://github.com/Seymour22/Neural-Networks/blob/main/Project%202%20Histology%20colourisation%20using%20conditional%20GAN.ipynb) I predict the colourisation of histology samples from their grey-scale images using a conditional GAN.


In [Project 3](https://github.com/Seymour22/Neural-networks/blob/main/Project%203%20Layer-wise%20Relevance%20Propagation%20(LRP)%20algorithm%20for%20a%20CNN.ipynb) Here I implement a LRP for a CNN that classifies the type of brain tumor. The LRP operates by propagating the prediction backward in the neural network and is a function of neuron activations and weights as explained in https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-28954-6_10.
